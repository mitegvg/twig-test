# Group Array Script

## Get Started

First run `npm install` to install the dev dependencies. I assume you already have node/npm installed on your machine.

To run the basic script with sample input run `npm start`

## Tests

To run the tests just run `npm test`. You can read about the various combinations of tests:

* Simple array input, divided by 3
* Simple array input, divided by 2
* Large array of elements
* Complex array, divided by 2
* Complex array, divided by 4
* Complex nested array, divided by 3

## Structure

The main functions are placed in index.js. The only test file is group.test.js and the start script is start.js
